# There are thousands of operational satellites up there.

And there's so many questions I have about them!
- What does it take to get a satellite up there? Does it change depending on whether you're in a low-earth orbit?
- Who owns each of these satellites? How long are they designed to be up there for?
- Is there a space junk pollution problem? What does that mean for future satellite expansions?
- What are they all used for? Who owns what?
- How do we stop them from crashing into each other? I'm not hopeful that we're all coordinating launches, a crash seems likely!
- If we removed a specific satellite, what repercussions would that have down here?

... and that's with a couple of minutes of thinking! It's such a mysterious space. To better understand it I'll be visualisation them all, 
where the visualisation and programming environment can act as a substrate to build simulations to answer some of the above questions!

# Requirements

more to come here, but for earlycomers you just need three.js for now.
